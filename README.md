```

Make sure all the required software (listed above) is installed, then cd into one of the box directories and run:

## Testing built boxes

There's an included Vagrantfile that allows quick testing of the built Vagrant boxes. From the same box directory, run the following command after building the box:

```bash
  vagrant up
```

Test that the box works correctly, then tear it down with:

```bash
  vagrant destroy -f
```

## ChecksumÂ SHA256

```bash
  shasum -a 256 ubuntu-20.04-arm64.parallels.box
```

### Error
1. "Build 'ubuntu-2004' errored after 41 milliseconds 278 microseconds: Failed creating Parallels driver: Parallels Virtualization SDK is not installed"

```bash
